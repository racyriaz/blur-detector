Hello HR!
I welcome you to my assessment!
Topic: Predicting Blurred images and clear images
----------------------------------------------------------------
Simple and short(Instructions):
1) I would request you to install Anaconda Jupyter Notebook to on your computer to view these files
	Worst_Case:(make use of the provided .py version of the .ipynb file)


2) Inside the >>mohamed_riaz_77.zip<< file you will have two folders namely Method_1 and Method_2

	* Method_1_with_SVM_model_OpenCV folder contains	 >> SVM_and_logReg_OpenCV.ipynb <<, please open it!

		Inside this notebook we have
		a) SVM model with an accuracy of about 71.3% 
		b) Logistic_Regression with an accuracy of about 65.2%
	further details and discriptions of the code is provided inside the .ipynb file



3) Method_2_CNN folder contains deep learning solution for the problem statement that is divided into two parts
	
	Part_1_CNN.ipynb contains loading of X and y components
	Part_2_CNN.ipynb contains Building CNN model, training it on the datas that were stored as pickle file from Part_1_CNN.ipynb
	
	finally in Part_2_CNN.ipynb we will evaluate our model with True and Predicted values which has an accuracy of about 77.43%

4) Have fun with coding!
